## üéÆ Introduce about the project
This is the project I did for the entrance test of the smilegate 2025 internship for the frontend engineer intern position.

## üîß About the Technology

- **Framework:** Built with [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com), a powerful full-stack framework based on Vue 3.
- **UI Library:** Utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for utility-first, responsive, and customizable styling.
- **Package Manager:** Managed using [Bun](https://bun.sh) for fast dependency installation and execution.
- **Linter:** Code formatting and linting are enforced with [ESLint](https://eslint.org).
- **Backend Engine:** Uses Nuxt 3 Server Engine (Nitro) for server-side logic and API routes.
- **Database:** Connected to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for scalable cloud-based data storage.

```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=<Your_MongoDB_Atlas_connection_string>
```



3. **Install dependencies:**

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
